Hello, this is my hacked version of libnotify. It is supposed to be used with
my notification-daemon engine:

http://github.com/tatofoo/notification-daemon-engine-coco

What does it do?
----------------
Well, it ignores requests from applications to set the notification position
near an icon or widget.

For now it is just a commented out line, but in the next days I'll be adding
a key to the gconf schema so you can enable or disable this hack.
